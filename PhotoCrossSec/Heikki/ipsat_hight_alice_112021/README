Calculations with and without proton substructure. 
Directory "with_proton_flux" contains predcitions including the photon flux: d\sigma / dt dy for the process
Pb+Pb -> Jpsi + Pb + Pb (or Pb* in case of incoherent)

File format:
-t [GeV^2]   d\sigma/dtdy [mb]/GeV^2

Directory "no_photon_flux" contains the same predictions but wihtout the photon flux, so for the process gamma + Pb -> JPsi + Pb (or Pb^*)

File format is exactly the same

Intereference effect is note included, it should have a small effect here.




== Technical details ==

Calculation using IPsat dipole-proton amplitude
Fitted to HERA in arXiv:1804.05311

JPsi wave function: Boosted Gaussian with parameters from 1804.05311

Minor differences compared to the above cited article:
* Correct off-forward phase (1/2-z)r.Delta is used in scattering amplitude instead of (1-z)r.Delta
* Updated IPsat fit is used

Internal git commit: b419497fffb1c15fd982f4c670050ed220484272

Effects at the cross section level are small
